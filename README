The project is organized using Docker, for better portability, but you can run it from your host os if you have PHP installed.

HOW TO RUN:

->Terminal
Open a terminal or a CMD at the same location where the files are and run the following command:

php mainCsv.php

->Using docker

Steps:
1) Open a terminal and execute: docker build -t php-app .  (build the image)
2) Then execute: docker run -d --name php-app (runs the container)
3) Now, we have to connect to the container, execute : docker exec -it php-app /bin/bash
4) Inside the container run the script: php mainCsv.php


**There are two main files: mainCsv.php , CsvProcessor.php

-mainCsv.php: The file where we create the instance of the CsvProcessor class and we ask for the user's input.

-CsvProcessor.php: Is the class where the main functions are located. In the begging we define an array with the .csv files we will 
work with. In this example the files are two, but the code works for unlimited files, as long as we insert their names in the array.

Functions: 

*readfiles() : In this function, we loop through the files and create a final file (finalScore.csv) with the scores calculated together 
for each individual.

*SearchForName() : This function accepts a user's name, search the final file and prints the user's score ,if found, else it prints 
an error message.
